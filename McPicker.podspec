McPicker is a UIPickerView drop-in solution with animations that is rotation ready. The more string arrays you pass, the more picker components you'll get. You can set custom label or use the defaults. McPicker can be presented as a Popover on iPhone or iPad using showAsPopover, as an inputView using McTextField or use the default slide up and down style show.

showAsPopover can be used to display from a UIView or UIBarButtonItem. showAsPopover will always be presented as a Popover, even when used on an iPhone.
